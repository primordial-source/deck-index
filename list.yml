      Hi Everyone,
      
      The list of the week comes from the first **Innistrad**, it's an adaptation of the Delver deck which exist in Legacy actually.
      Like the legacy deck, it is in a **Grixis(UBR)** shell too.
      
      The playset of __Bump in the night__ does 12 damages without flashback. Where this "option" is for late game. Transformed __Delver__ can deal in general 3 or 6 damages. Then u can finish with __Geistflame__ (flashbacked or not) or with __Devil's play__.
      
      The deck is a midrange one, so you are strong against control, "slow" aggro/midrange deck. Big aggro lists like decks that put/play lot of beast on board or strong beast(eg : 5/5 beast), they are your difficult match up. With __Rolling temblor__ you can have a better MU against fast one, and __Victim of Night__ and __Tribute to Hunger__ for strong beast.
